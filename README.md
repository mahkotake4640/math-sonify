**Math sonification** is the practice of mapping the evolving state of a mathematical system directly to audio synthesis parameters so that the structure of the mathematics becomes audible. math-sonify runs differential equations continuously in real time and routes every variable of their state vector into oscillator frequencies, grain densities, FM modulation indices, formant positions, or waveguide string parameters. The result is not a preset synthesizer with math-themed names: the Lorenz attractor is actually integrating, the Kuramoto coupling constant is live, the Three-Body gravitational problem is stepped forward at 120 Hz.

## What is math sonification?

Classical sonification maps data to sound after the fact (load a CSV, play it back). Math sonification is generative and continuous: the sound is the running computation. There is no playback cursor; the audio is produced by the physics as it happens.

This makes the technique useful for:
- Auditory exploration of dynamical system behavior (period doubling, chaos onset, synchronization).
- Generative music where the mathematical constraints of the attractor act as a compositional structure.
- Live performance: parameter changes propagate to audio within one control-rate frame (8 ms at 120 Hz).

## Architecture

```
ODE Solver (120 Hz, sim thread)
    |
    |  53 dynamical systems — Lorenz, Rossler, Duffing, Kuramoto, Three-Body,
    |  Hyperchaos (4D), Finance, WINDMI, Liu, Genesio-Tesi, Shimizu-Morioka, ...
    |  RK4 integration per configured dt
    |
    v
Parameter Morphing (arrangement layer)
    |
    |  Scene arranger linearly interpolates all numeric config fields
    |  between named snapshots; string fields switch at midpoint
    |
    v
Sonification Mapper (sim thread, 120 Hz)
    |
    |  DirectMapping    -- state quantized to musical scale -> oscillator freqs
    |  OrbitalResonance -- angular velocity + Lyapunov exponent drive pitch
    |  GranularMapping  -- trajectory speed -> grain density and pitch
    |  SpectralMapping  -- state -> 32-partial additive envelope
    |  FmMapping        -- attractor drives carrier/modulator ratio and index
    |  AmMapping        -- amplitude modulation driven by state variables
    |  VocalMapping     -- state interpolates between vowel formant positions
    |  Waveguide        -- Karplus-Strong string with chaotic modulation
    |  Resonator        -- modal resonator bank driven by attractor
    |
    v  [crossbeam bounded channel, try_recv in audio callback]
    v
Audio Synthesis (audio thread, 44100 / 48000 Hz)
    |
    |  Per-layer DSP:
    |    Oscillator(s) [PolyBLEP anti-aliased] --> ADSR --> Waveshaper --> Bitcrusher
    |
    |  Master bus (shared across up to 4 layers):
    |    3-Band EQ --> LP BiquadFilter --> Stereo DelayLine --> Chorus
    |    --> FDN Reverb (8-channel, modulated) --> Lookahead Limiter
    |
    v
DAW (VST3 / CLAP plugin) or Desktop (standalone cpal output)
```

**Thread safety:** the sim thread and audio thread communicate through a bounded `crossbeam-channel` of capacity 16. The audio callback calls `try_recv` and renders silence on a miss, so it is never blocked. The UI thread reads shared state through `parking_lot::Mutex` on the control rate.

## Sonification modes (9)

| Mode | How math maps to audio |
|------|------------------------|
| Direct | State variables quantized to configured scale → oscillator frequencies. Amplitude tracks normalized magnitude. |
| Orbital | State interpreted as polar coordinates. Angular velocity drives pitch; Lyapunov exponent modulates inharmonicity. |
| Granular | Trajectory speed controls grain spawn rate (0–50 grains/sec). Position in state space sets grain frequency. |
| Spectral | 32 additive partials. Each partial amplitude derived from a normalized component of the state vector. |
| FM | Two-operator FM synthesis. Carrier tracks first state variable; modulator ratio and index driven by remaining variables. |
| AM | Amplitude modulation. Carrier frequency from state; AM depth and rate driven by trajectory speed. |
| Vocal | State coordinates mapped to vowel formant positions (F1/F2). Trajectory wanders through /a/ /e/ /i/ /o/ /u/. |
| Waveguide | Karplus-Strong string model. Tension and damping modulated by the attractor in real time. |
| Resonator | Modal resonator bank. Attractor state excites a set of tuned resonant modes. |

## Presets

math-sonify ships with ~40 named presets organized into four moods:

- **Atmospheric** — Midnight Approach, Breathing Galaxy, Aurora Borealis, Deep Hypnosis, Cathedral Organ, Substorm, and more.
- **Rhythmic** — Frozen Machinery, The Phase Transition, Clockwork Insect, Industrial Heartbeat, Velocity Band, and more.
- **Experimental** — Neon Labyrinth, Dissociation, Jerk Circuit, Invisible Hand, Hyperchaos Engine, and more.
- **Melodic** — Glass Harp, Electric Kelp, The Butterfly's Aria, Solar Wind, and more.

The **AUTO** arrangement generator picks 6 presets from a mood pool, scatters system parameters into varied dynamical regimes, randomizes synthesis settings, and builds an 8-scene timeline with morphs as the main musical event.

---

## Audio output

math-sonify outputs **32-bit IEEE float stereo PCM** at the system default sample rate (44100 or 48000 Hz).

| Export method | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Clip save (`S`) | Last 60 seconds → 32-bit float WAV in `clips/` |
| Loop export | Current loop region → WAV |
| Headless render | `--headless --duration 60 --output clip.wav` — no display required |

### Pre-built binary (Windows)

Download `math-sonify.exe` from the [latest release](https://github.com/Mattbusel/math-sonify/releases/latest) and run it. No dependencies, no install.

### From source

Requires [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) 1.75+ and a working audio output device.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Mattbusel/math-sonify
cd math-sonify
cargo run --release
```

### Build the VST3 / CLAP plugin

```bash
cargo build --release --lib
```

Copy the output to your DAW plugin folder:

## Configuration

The application reads `config.toml` from the current working directory at startup. The file is watched with `notify`; edits take effect without restarting.

## GUI

Five top-level tabs:

- **SYNTH** — system selector, parameter sliders, sonification mode, scale, effects chain, randomize.
- **MIXER** — per-layer volume/pan/ADSR, master effects (EQ, delay, chorus, reverb), VU meters, WAV export.
- **ARRANGE** — scene timeline, morph time controls, AUTO arrangement generator with mood selection.
- **MATH VIEW** — live phase portrait (XY/XZ/YZ/3D), bifurcation diagram, custom ODE text input, state readout.
- **WAVEFORM** — oscilloscope and spectrum analyzer.

Performance mode (`F`) switches to fullscreen phase portrait only.

## Building and testing

```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests (~1650 tests, no display required)
cargo test --lib --tests

# Release binary
cargo build --release --bin math-sonify

# Release plugin
cargo build --release --lib

# Documentation
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

The test suite covers: ODE solver accuracy (attractor bounds, energy conservation, synchronization thresholds), scale quantization, polyphony, config parsing and clamping, scene arranger timeline consistency, oscillator amplitude bounds, ADSR envelope behavior, all-presets load/validate, lerp_config correctness for every system, and bifurcation parameter sweeps.

---

## Troubleshooting

**No audio / device not found**
- math-sonify uses `cpal::default_host().default_output_device()`. Ensure a device is selected in OS audio settings.
- Windows exclusive mode: close any application holding the device exclusively.
- Linux ALSA: `sudo apt install libasound2-dev`, add user to `audio` group.
- Sample rate mismatch: set `sample_rate = 48000` in `config.toml`.

**High CPU usage**
- Increase `buffer_size` to 1024 or 2048.
- Disable Evolve mode when not in use.
- For Three-Body and Lorenz-96, reduce `system.speed`.

**Distorted audio**
- Lower `audio.master_volume`.
- Set `waveshaper_drive = 1.0` and `waveshaper_mix = 0.0`.

**Phase portrait blank**
- Wait 2–3 seconds for the trail to build after startup or after pressing `R`.

**Config not loading**
- math-sonify looks for `config.toml` in the **current working directory**.

**VST3/CLAP not appearing**
- Copy to the correct system folder and trigger a plugin rescan in your DAW.
- The plugin requires `cargo build --release --lib`, not `--bin`.

## Contributing

1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Run `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
3. Add tests for new public API (unit tests in the module, integration tests in `tests/integration.rs`).
4. Open a pull request. CI (fmt, clippy, test, doc, release build) must pass.

Code style: no `unsafe` without comment, no `.unwrap()` in `src/` outside tests, audio thread must be real-time safe (no heap allocation, no blocking I/O).

math-sonify is a real-time generative audio engine that runs mathematical dynamical systems — differential equations, maps, and coupled oscillators — and routes every variable of their evolving state directly into audio synthesis parameters. The Lorenz attractor is actually integrating at 120 Hz; the Kuramoto coupling constant is live; the Three-Body gravitational problem advances at each control frame. The result is not a preset synthesiser with math-themed names: the mathematics _is_ the music, and every parameter change propagates to sound within 8 ms.

## Feature highlights

1. **53 dynamical systems** — Lorenz, Rossler, Double Pendulum, Kuramoto, Three-Body, Hyperchaos (Chen-Li), WINDMI, Finance, all Sprott cases, Tinkerbell map, and more (full list below).
2. **9 sonification modes** — Direct, Orbital, Granular, Spectral, FM, AM, Vocal, Waveguide, Resonator.
3. **20 musical scales** — Pentatonic through Microtonal, EDO-19/24/31, Harmonic Series, Just Intonation.
4. **MIDI export** — trajectory-to-MIDI conversion; outputs Standard MIDI Files (SMF) importable into any DAW.
5. **Preset gallery** — 16+ named presets with mood tags, complexity ratings, favorites, and a discovery mode that surfaces less-played entries.
6. **Collaborative session mode** — real-time multi-user parameter control via a WebSocket server with per-participant colour highlights, conflict resolution, and full session replay log.
7. **Audio-driven ODE morphing** — reverse the sonification pipeline: incoming microphone audio extracts features (RMS, spectral centroid, flux, 8-band energy) and maps them to ODE parameters in real time. Can run simultaneously with the forward synthesis path (dual mode).
8. **Lyapunov exponent tracker** — real-time estimation of the maximal Lyapunov exponent; displayed in the MATH VIEW tab.
9. **FFT spectral overlay** — live FFT spectrum superimposed on the phase portrait and the WAVEFORM tab.
10. **Scene arranger** — 8-scene timeline with smooth parameter morphs; AUTO generator builds full arrangements from a mood pool.
11. **VST3 / CLAP plugin** — load inside Ableton, FL Studio, Logic Pro, Reaper, and any other NIH-plug-compatible DAW.
12. **Headless render** — `--headless --duration 60 --output clip.wav` with no display required.
13. **Live config reload** — edit `config.toml` while the engine runs; changes take effect without restart.

## Architecture

```
ODE Solver (120 Hz, sim thread)
    |
    |  53 dynamical systems -- Lorenz, Rossler, Duffing, Kuramoto, Three-Body,
    |  Hyperchaos (4D), Finance, WINDMI, Liu, Genesio-Tesi, Shimizu-Morioka, ...
    |  RK4 integration per configured dt
    |
    v
Parameter Morphing (arrangement layer)
    |
    |  Scene arranger linearly interpolates all numeric config fields
    |  between named snapshots; string fields switch at midpoint
    |
    v
Sonification Mapper (sim thread, 120 Hz)
    |
    |  DirectMapping    -- state quantized to musical scale -> oscillator freqs
    |  OrbitalResonance -- angular velocity + Lyapunov exponent drive pitch
    |  GranularMapping  -- trajectory speed -> grain density and pitch
    |  SpectralMapping  -- state -> 32-partial additive envelope
    |  FmMapping        -- attractor drives carrier/modulator ratio and index
    |  AmMapping        -- amplitude modulation driven by state variables
    |  VocalMapping     -- state interpolates between vowel formant positions
    |  Waveguide        -- Karplus-Strong string with chaotic modulation
    |  Resonator        -- modal resonator bank driven by attractor
    |
    v  [crossbeam bounded channel, try_recv in audio callback]
    v
Audio Synthesis (audio thread, 44100 / 48000 Hz)
    |
    |  Per-layer DSP:
    |    Oscillator(s) [PolyBLEP anti-aliased] --> ADSR --> Waveshaper --> Bitcrusher
    |
    |  Master bus (shared across up to 4 layers):
    |    3-Band EQ --> LP BiquadFilter --> Stereo DelayLine --> Chorus
    |    --> FDN Reverb (8-channel, modulated) --> Lookahead Limiter
    |
    v
DAW (VST3 / CLAP plugin) or Desktop (standalone cpal output)
```

**Thread safety:** the sim thread and audio thread communicate through a bounded `crossbeam-channel` of capacity 16. The audio callback calls `try_recv` and renders silence on a miss, so it is never blocked. The UI thread reads shared state through `parking_lot::Mutex` on the control rate.

## MIDI export guide

math-sonify can export attractor trajectories to Standard MIDI Files (SMF format 0) that import cleanly into Ableton Live, FL Studio, Logic Pro, Reaper, and any other DAW.

### Mapping

| Attractor coordinate | MIDI parameter |
|---|---|
| X | Note pitch -- quantised to the selected scale |
| Y | Velocity (64-127) |
| Z | Note duration (16th note to whole note, exponentially scaled) |
| Simulation speed | BPM written into the file tempo event |

### From the GUI

1. Open the **MIXER** tab.
2. Click **Record MIDI** to start capturing. The status bar shows the frame count.
3. Click **Stop + Export** to choose a filename and write the `.mid` file.

### From Rust code

```rust
use math_sonify_plugin::midi_export::{MidiExporter, SCALE_PENTATONIC_C4};

// trajectory is a Vec<(f64, f64, f64)> collected from the ODE solver
let exporter = MidiExporter::new();   // 480 ticks per quarter note
let track = exporter.trajectory_to_track(
    "Lorenz Take 1",
    &trajectory,
    SCALE_PENTATONIC_C4,
    120.0,   // BPM
);
exporter.export_to_file(&[track], "lorenz_take1.mid")?;
```

Multiple tracks can be passed to `export_smf` / `export_to_file`; they are merged into the single track required by SMF format 0, with each track's notes placed on a different MIDI channel (0-15) for DAW separation.

### Headless export

```bash
cargo run --release -- --headless --duration 30 --output take.wav --export-midi take.mid
```

## Preset gallery guide

math-sonify ships with 16 named presets organised in a browsable in-memory catalogue. Each preset carries:

- **System** -- which dynamical system it uses.
- **Mood tags** -- `atmospheric`, `rhythmic`, `experimental`, `meditative`, `melodic`, `percussive`, `drone`, `eerie`, `evolving`, `hypnotic`, `minimalist`, `complex`, `electronic`, `energetic`.
- **BPM range** -- the tempo window in which the preset sounds best.
- **Complexity** -- 1 (minimal) to 5 (dense).

### In the GUI

The **SYNTH** tab has a **Presets** panel with:

- A scrollable list filtered by mood or system.
- A search box for partial name/description match.
- A heart icon to toggle favorites.
- A **Discover** button that picks a random preset weighted toward entries you have played least.

### From Rust code

```rust
use math_sonify_plugin::preset_gallery::PresetGallery;

let mut gallery = PresetGallery::with_builtin_presets();

// Filter by mood
let drones = gallery.by_mood("drone");

// Search
let results = gallery.search("butterfly");

// Random discovery (weighted by inverse play count)
if let Some(preset) = gallery.random_discovery() {
    println!("Try: {} ({})", preset.name, preset.system);
    gallery.record_play(&preset.name.clone());
}

// Favorites
gallery.toggle_favorite("Lorenz Ambience");
let favs = gallery.favorites();
```

### Built-in presets

| Name | System | Moods | Complexity |
|------|--------|-------|-----------|
| Lorenz Ambience | Lorenz | atmospheric, meditative, melodic | 2 |
| Pendulum Rhythm | Double Pendulum | rhythmic, percussive, energetic | 3 |
| Torus Drone | Geodesic Torus | atmospheric, meditative, drone | 2 |
| Kuramoto Sync | Kuramoto | experimental, evolving, hypnotic | 3 |
| Three-Body Jazz | Three-Body | melodic, rhythmic, complex | 4 |
| Rossler Drift | Rossler | atmospheric, melodic, meditative | 2 |
| FM Chaos | Lorenz | experimental, electronic, energetic | 4 |

## Collaborative session guide

math-sonify includes two complementary collaboration features: a low-level protocol (`collaboration.rs`) for sharing attractor state between performers, and a full-featured **Collaborative Session** server (`collab.rs`) for real-time multi-user parameter editing.

### Collaborative Session server (`collab.rs`)

The session server is a raw-TCP WebSocket-style server that accepts JSON connections from any number of participants. Each participant can claim ownership of specific ODE parameters, edit them in real time, and all changes propagate immediately to every other connected client.

**Key types:**

| Type | Role |
|------|------|
| `CollabServer` | TCP listener; spawns a thread per client |
| `SessionEvent` | Events emitted to the simulation thread (`ParamChanged`, `ClientJoined`, `ClientLeft`) |
| `SharedSynthState` | ODE parameters + sonification mode + scale, wrapped in `Arc<RwLock<>>` for lock-free reads |
| `ParticipantCursor` | Each participant has a unique colour highlight on the parameter they are currently editing |
| `SessionLog` | Full ordered history of every parameter change for post-session replay |

**Wire protocol** (newline-delimited JSON):

```json
// Client -> Server
{ "claim":   ["rho", "sigma"] }
{ "set":     { "rho": 28.5 } }
{ "release": ["rho"] }

// Server -> Client
{ "welcome":     { "client_id": 3 } }
{ "update":      { "rho": 28.5, "owner": 3 } }
{ "error":       "parameter 'rho' is owned by client 1" }
{ "peer_joined": { "client_id": 4, "total": 2 } }
{ "peer_left":   { "client_id": 4, "total": 1 } }
```

**Conflict resolution:** last-write-wins per parameter. A participant must first `claim` a parameter; attempts to `set` an unclaimed or foreign-owned parameter are rejected with an `error` message.

**Starting the server:**

```rust
use math_sonify_plugin::collab::{CollabServer, SessionEvent};
use crossbeam_channel::unbounded;

let (tx, rx) = unbounded::<SessionEvent>();
let server = CollabServer::new("127.0.0.1:9001", tx).unwrap();
server.run_background();

// In the simulation thread:
for event in rx.try_iter() {
    match event {
        SessionEvent::ParamChanged { name, value, .. } => { /* apply to ODE */ }
        _ => {}
    }
}
```

Connect any WebSocket client (browser, `websocat`, Python `websockets`) to `ws://127.0.0.1:9001` to join the session.

### Legacy performance protocol (`collaboration.rs`)

math-sonify also includes a JSON-based collaborative performance protocol that lets multiple performers share attractor state in real time. Any transport layer (WebSocket, UDP, OSC) can carry the messages; the module itself only handles serialisation and session logic.

### Concepts

- **Session** -- a named room (e.g. `"concert-2026-03-22"`) that holds up to 8 performers.
- **Performer** -- identified by a unique string ID, carries live `(x, y, z)` attractor coordinates, BPM, volume, and an RGB colour.
- **Messages** -- typed JSON objects: `JoinSession`, `LeaveSession`, `StateUpdate`, `ParameterSync`, `ChatMessage`, `KickOff`.

### Example flow

```rust
use math_sonify_plugin::collaboration::{CollaborationClient, PerformerState};

// Create local performer
let performer = PerformerState::new("alice-01", "Alice");
let mut client = CollaborationClient::new(performer);

// Join
let join_msg = client.join_message("my-session");
let json = CollaborationClient::serialize_message(&join_msg);
// ... send json over your WebSocket / UDP socket ...

// Each sim tick: push current attractor state
let update = client.push_xyz(lorenz_x, lorenz_y, lorenz_z);
let json = CollaborationClient::serialize_message(&update);
// ... send json ...

// Receive a message
let incoming_json = r#"{"type":"KickOff","session_id":"my-session","bpm":128.0}"#;
let msg = CollaborationClient::deserialize_message(incoming_json).unwrap();
```

### Server-side session tracking

```rust
use math_sonify_plugin::collaboration::CollaborationSession;

let mut session = CollaborationSession::new("my-session");

// On receive JoinSession
session.join(performer_state)?;

// On receive StateUpdate
session.update_state(performer_state);

// Broadcast mean-attractor coordinates to new joiners
let sync_msg = session.broadcast_message();
```

### Message reference

```json
{ "type": "JoinSession",   "session_id": "room1", "performer": { ... } }
{ "type": "LeaveSession",  "performer_id": "alice-01" }
{ "type": "StateUpdate",   "performer": { "x": 1.2, "y": -3.4, "z": 0.8, ... } }
{ "type": "ParameterSync", "params": { "rho": 28.0, "sigma": 10.0 } }
{ "type": "ChatMessage",   "performer_id": "alice-01", "text": "raising sigma now" }
{ "type": "KickOff",       "session_id": "room1", "bpm": 128.0 }
```

## Presets

math-sonify ships with ~40 named presets organised into four moods:

- **Atmospheric** -- Midnight Approach, Breathing Galaxy, Aurora Borealis, Deep Hypnosis, Cathedral Organ, Substorm, and more.
- **Rhythmic** -- Frozen Machinery, The Phase Transition, Clockwork Insect, Industrial Heartbeat, Velocity Band, and more.
- **Experimental** -- Neon Labyrinth, Dissociation, Jerk Circuit, Invisible Hand, Hyperchaos Engine, and more.
- **Melodic** -- Glass Harp, Electric Kelp, The Butterfly's Aria, Solar Wind, and more.

The **AUTO** arrangement generator picks 6 presets from a mood pool, scatters system parameters into varied dynamical regimes, randomises synthesis settings, and builds an 8-scene timeline with morphs as the main musical event.

---

## Audio output

math-sonify outputs 32-bit IEEE float stereo PCM at the system default sample rate (44100 or 48000 Hz).

| Export method | Details |
|---------------|---------|
| Clip save (`S`) | Last 60 seconds -> 32-bit float WAV in `clips/` |
| Loop export | Current loop region -> WAV |
| MIDI export | Trajectory -> SMF `.mid` importable into any DAW |
| Headless render | `--headless --duration 60 --output clip.wav` -- no display required |

## Audio-driven ODE morphing guide

In addition to the classic forward pipeline (ODE state → audio), math-sonify can reverse the flow: use **incoming microphone audio** to continuously modify ODE parameters in real time.

### How it works

```
Microphone / line-in (cpal default input)
    |
    v  per-frame (configurable hop size, default 512 samples)
AudioInputAnalyzer
    |  computes:
    |    RMS        → Lorenz σ  (louder = more chaos, σ ∈ [5, 30])
    |    Centroid   → Lorenz ρ  (brighter spectrum = higher ρ, ρ ∈ [15, 60])
    |    Flux       → system switch trigger (transients trigger attractor changes)
    |    8-band energy → Lorenz β (mid-band energy → β ∈ [1.5, 4.0])
    v
AudioFeatures { rms, centroid, flux, bands: [f32; 8] }
    |
    v
AudioOdeBridge  (delta suppression: only emits patch when change exceeds threshold)
    |
    v
OdePatch → simulation thread (applies sigma/rho/beta overrides)
```

### Dual mode

`DualMode` lets both pipelines run simultaneously:

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `ForwardOnly` | Classic: ODE state drives audio synthesis (default) |
| `ReverseOnly` | Microphone input drives ODE parameters only |
| `Both` | Both paths active simultaneously — environment modulates the attractor which modulates the sound which feeds back into the environment |

### Usage

```rust
use math_sonify_plugin::audio_driven::{AudioOdeBridge, BridgeConfig, DualMode, DualModeKind};
use crossbeam_channel::unbounded;

// Build the reverse pipeline
let dual = DualMode::new(BridgeConfig::default());
let (mut analyzer, patch_rx, _stop) = dual.build_reverse_pipeline();

// Feed audio samples from cpal input callback:
// analyzer.feed(sample);  // called per sample in the cpal callback

// In the simulation thread:
for patch in patch_rx.try_iter() {
    if let Some(sigma) = patch.sigma { ode_params.sigma = sigma; }
    if let Some(rho)   = patch.rho   { ode_params.rho   = rho;   }
    if patch.trigger_system_switch   { /* switch to next attractor */ }
}
```

### Configuration (`BridgeConfig`)

| Field | Default | Description |
|-------|---------|-------------|
| `sigma_min` / `sigma_max` | 5.0 / 30.0 | Lorenz σ range |
| `rho_min` / `rho_max` | 15.0 / 60.0 | Lorenz ρ range |
| `beta_min` / `beta_max` | 1.5 / 4.0 | Lorenz β range |
| `flux_switch_threshold` | 0.6 | Flux above this triggers a system switch |
| `fft_size` | 1024 | FFT frame size (power of two) |
| `hop_size` | 512 | Samples between analysis frames |

## Mathematical background

### Dynamical systems and attractors

A **dynamical system** is a set of differential equations `dx/dt = f(x)` or a map `x_{n+1} = f(x_n)`. The long-term behaviour of trajectories in phase space determines the system's character:

- **Fixed point** — all trajectories converge to a single point (stable equilibrium).
- **Limit cycle** — trajectories converge to a closed loop (periodic oscillation).
- **Quasi-periodic** — trajectories wind around a torus; the ratio of frequencies is irrational.
- **Chaotic attractor (strange attractor)** — trajectories are bounded but never repeat; nearby trajectories diverge exponentially (sensitive dependence on initial conditions).

### Lyapunov exponents

The **maximal Lyapunov exponent** λ₁ quantifies the average rate of exponential divergence of nearby trajectories:

```
||δx(t)|| ≈ e^{λ₁ t} ||δx(0)||
```

- λ₁ < 0: stable fixed point or limit cycle.
- λ₁ = 0: quasi-periodic or at a bifurcation boundary.
- λ₁ > 0: chaotic. The Lorenz system at standard parameters has λ₁ ≈ 0.906.

math-sonify estimates λ₁ using a standard rescaling algorithm: a shadow trajectory is integrated alongside the main one, the separation is measured every N steps, its logarithm is accumulated, and the separation is rescaled. This runs at `LYAP_INTERVAL_TICKS` (every 2 seconds of sim time).

### FFT spectral analysis

The FFT module (`spectrum.rs`) computes a 1024-point Hann-windowed FFT of the synthesised audio output and displays:

- Magnitude spectrum (dB scale, linear frequency axis).
- Spectral centroid (brightness indicator).
- Fundamental frequency estimate via parabolic interpolation on the magnitude peak.

The audio-driven morphing module uses the same FFT on the *input* signal to extract audio features.

### Chaos onset in the Lorenz system

The Lorenz system `(σ=10, β=8/3, ρ)` undergoes the following transitions as ρ increases:

| ρ range | Behaviour |
|---------|-----------|
| ρ < 1 | All trajectories converge to origin |
| 1 < ρ < 13.93 | Two stable fixed points (C+ and C−) |
| 13.93 < ρ < 24.06 | Unstable limit cycles; trajectories still attracted to C± |
| ρ > 24.74 | Strange attractor (chaos onset) — the classic butterfly |

## Building and testing

```bash
# Run all unit and integration tests (~1650 tests, no display required)
cargo test --lib --tests

# Release binary
cargo build --release --bin math-sonify

# Release plugin
cargo build --release --lib

# Documentation
cargo doc --no-deps --open
```

The test suite covers: ODE solver accuracy (attractor bounds, energy conservation, synchronization thresholds), scale quantization, polyphony, config parsing and clamping, scene arranger timeline consistency, oscillator amplitude bounds, ADSR envelope behavior, all-presets load/validate, lerp_config correctness for every system, bifurcation parameter sweeps, MIDI frame recording and SMF export, preset gallery filtering and discovery, and collaboration session/client message round-trips.

## Troubleshooting

**No audio / device not found**
- math-sonify uses `cpal::default_host().default_output_device()`. Ensure a device is selected in OS audio settings.
- Windows exclusive mode: close any application holding the device exclusively.
- Linux ALSA: `sudo apt install libasound2-dev`, add user to `audio` group.
- Sample rate mismatch: set `sample_rate = 48000` in `config.toml`.

**High CPU usage**
- Increase `buffer_size` to 1024 or 2048.
- Disable Evolve mode when not in use.
- For Three-Body and Lorenz-96, reduce `system.speed`.

**Distorted audio**
- Lower `audio.master_volume`.
- Set `waveshaper_drive = 1.0` and `waveshaper_mix = 0.0`.

**Phase portrait blank**
- Wait 2-3 seconds for the trail to build after startup or after pressing `R`.

**Config not loading**
- math-sonify looks for `config.toml` in the **current working directory**.

**VST3/CLAP not appearing**
- Copy to the correct system folder and trigger a plugin rescan in your DAW.
- The plugin requires `cargo build --release --lib`, not `--bin`.

**MIDI export produces empty file**
- Start recording before the session (click **Record MIDI** in the MIXER tab), then export.
- Headless: pass `--export-midi output.mid` on the command line.

## Contributing

1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Run `cargo fmt --all` and `cargo clippy --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings`.
3. Add tests for new public API (unit tests in the module, integration tests in `tests/integration.rs`).
4. Open a pull request. CI (fmt, clippy, test, doc, release build) must pass.

Code style: no `unsafe` without comment, no `.unwrap()` in `src/` outside tests, audio thread must be real-time safe (no heap allocation, no blocking I/O).

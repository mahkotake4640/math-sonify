/// ADSR envelope generator (per-sample) with exponential curves.
///
/// **Why exponential?**
/// Real-world instrument envelopes follow RC-circuit physics: decay and release
/// are exponential (each sample is a fixed fraction of the remaining distance
/// to zero).  Linear ADSR — the original implementation — sounds mechanical
/// because no acoustic instrument has a straight-line decay.  Exponential
/// curves give the characteristic "fast start, gentle tail" that makes a note
/// feel like it was struck rather than switched.
///
/// Attack remains linear (convex ramp): most percussive and plucked instruments
/// have near-linear onsets; exponential attack can sound sluggish.
///
/// Decay and Release use first-order IIR smoothing toward their targets:
///   `level = level * coeff + target * (1 - coeff)`
/// where `coeff = exp(-ln(1000) / time_in_samples)` ensures the envelope
/// reaches within 0.1% of target in exactly the specified time.

/// Digital waveguide string — two traveling-wave delay lines.
///
/// Improvements over the original:
///
/// 1. **Fractional-delay read** via linear interpolation: the delay length in
///    samples is rarely an integer, so integer rounding causes pitch quantization
///    errors (audible beating at low frequencies).  Interpolation gives true
///    intonation.
///
/// 2. **First-order IIR loop filter** (tunable brightness): replaces the naive
///    `(a + b) * 0.5` average.  The filter coefficient `b` trades off between a
///    bright metallic string (b ≈ 0) and a dark muffled one (b ≈ 0.9), with
///    independent control from the overall damping envelope.
///
/// 3. **Allpass dispersion filter** in the loop: a first-order allpass shifts
///    the phase of higher partials, causing the upper harmonics to arrive
///    slightly later than the fundamental — the defining "stiff string" quality
///    of piano and other struck/plucked strings.  Without this every partial
///    decays in exact lockstep and the result sounds like a pure electronic tone.
